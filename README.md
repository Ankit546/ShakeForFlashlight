# ShakeForFlashlight
Previously I had Moto e4 Plus in which you can turn ON/OFF the flashlight by shaking your phone using moto actions but in my new smartphone
it was not there! So I created this app. 

NOTE: First give this app to access your camera permission so that it can run.
Just shake your phone to turn on/off the flashlight.
